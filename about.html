        <!-- FOUNDING STORY -->
<section class="founding-story">
    <h2>Our Journey Began in 2018</h2>
    <p>
        At <strong>Law Office – Legal Solutions</strong>, we started with one goal in mind: to make legal services more human. In 2018, a group of experienced lawyers who were frustrated with the complexity and coldness of traditional legal systems came together to create something different. We wanted to build a law firm that <span class="highlight">puts people first</span>, not paperwork or processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name "<em class="highlight">Legal Solutions</em>" says everything about us: we’re not here to just argue cases, we’re here to help you <strong>solve problems</strong>. Whether it’s protecting your family, securing your business, or fighting for your rights, we approach every case with clarity, integrity, and a passion for making a real difference.
    </p>
    <p class="closing-line">
        From our early days in a small office to becoming a trusted name across the country, we've grown stronger with each client we’ve helped. We’re proud of where we are today — a law firm that blends <strong>heart and results</strong>, always focused on delivering justice with care.
